# MLOps Repo  

Welcome to my MLOps repo—a straight-up collection of scripts and projects that’s all about the Ops in MLOps. Forget chasing the highest accuracy for ML models; this is about building reliable pipelines, automating workflows, handling deployments, and keeping things running smoothly in production.  

The focus here isn’t on crafting state-of-the-art models but on making sure the entire system works like a charm.  

What you'll find:  
- Rock-solid scripts that get the job done.  
- Projects built for practicality over perfection.  
- A hands-on dive into the tools and workflows behind real-world ML systems.  

If you're looking to learn how to make ML actually work out in the wild, you’re in the right place. Let’s get to it.
