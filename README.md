# MLOps Repo  

Welcome to my MLOps repo—a no-nonsense collection of scripts and projects focused on the Ops side of MLOps. The goal here isn’t about squeezing out every bit of accuracy from ML models but about building systems that actually work, scale, and survive the chaos of production.  

This repo is for practical stuff—pipelines, automations, deployments, and all the behind-the-scenes action that makes ML useful in the real world.  

What you'll get:  
- Code that works. Period.  
- Projects focused more on making things run than fine-tuning models.  
- A hands-on approach to learning the tools and workflows that keep ML alive in production.  

If you're here for flashy models, this ain’t it. But if you're into building solid systems that just get the job done, you’re in the right spot.
